This mini project was made to display my knowledge and understand of the flask framework. This project consists of me using WTForms to create my forms on the website and read from them, Jinja was used to implement python code to the html and bootstrap-flask was used to style the forms. A csv file was used to read and write data. In order to run this code you need to install the required packages that are specified in the requirements.txt file. The website run is shown below:
